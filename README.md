# abstractalgorithms 

Reference implementations of useful algorithms, presented in an abstracted form

There are 3 main high-level modules to this library
- **lessons_learned**
  - _basically just a giant string you can print that has some of the qualitative lessons I learned while solving some 80+ leetcode problems_
- **general**
  - _abstracted implementations of more broadly usable algorithms_
- **specialized**
  - _clean, study-able implementations of algorithmically interesting solutions; not super useful._
